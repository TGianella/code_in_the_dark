I forked this to add templates in order to train more efficiently ! :muscle:

## How to Use
* Clone the repo
* Run `changeTemplate.sh *TEMPLATE_NAME*` (`random` loads a random template from `dist/templates`)
* Open `dist/editor.html` in your browser
* Enjoy !

## How to contribute templates
* Create a new folder in `dist/templates`
* Put the template as `page.png`
* Add all pictures used as assets in this folder
* Copy `instructions.html` and `result.html` from another template and paste to your template folder
* Modify instructions to fit your template (change assets paths and size, colors and texts)
* Push straight on master because we are not launching rockets and I am a trusting person :grin:
